                    <h1>Practice Policy</h1>
                    <p class="indent">Welcome to Fusion Family Consulting. Please read the following information carefully about our practice policies. Your understanding of these policies will help us work most effectively with you.</p>
                    <h2>Treatment Participation</h2>
                    <p class="indent">Our providers schedule most of their own appointments. Your treatment with us may involve taking medications and or engaging in psychotherapy. It is important that you take an active role in your treatment. If your treatment involves medication, your provider will explain the important risks benefits and side effects to you. If unexpected side effects are experienced upon taking medications, please call the office immediately.</p>
                    <h2>Confidentiality</h2>
                    <p class="indent">Anything you reveal in your sessions is confidential and cannot be released to another person without your consent. Exceptions to this rule of confidentiality occur when the provider reasonably believes that there is imminent risk of harm to yourself or another person, or if a judge requests information as part of a trial. Also, if we are filing to your insurance company diagnosis codes are sent and insurance may request medical records to process your claims.</p>
                    <h2>Phone Calls</h2>
                    <p class="indent">Our phone hours are Monday to Friday 9am-5pm. After hours calls will be returned for emergencies only. If there is an immediate medical emergency, please go to the nearest emergency room or call 911, if necessary. For other non-urgent calls, please leave both daytime and after-hours phone numbers where you can be reached.</p>
                    <h2>Insurance</h2>
                    <p class="indent">At this time, Dr. Isa is only in network with Blue Cross/Blue Shield. Cristin Dooley is not in network with any insurances. If you are self pay or have an out of network insurance, payment for services is due at the time of service. We will submit out of network claims for you and if your insurance pays we will reimburse you appropriately.</p>
                    <h2>Financial</h2>
                    <p class="indent">Payment is due at the time of the service. Both of our providers current charge is $250 an hour. Cash, check, Visa, MasterCard and Discover are accepted. Accounts not paid by the next billing cycle are subject to a service charge of $10 unless previous arrangements have been made with the provider. If payment is not provided at the time of a visit (such as a check is rejected or an appointment is not kept and payment is not sent in), then an authorized credit card will be required to be placed on file prior to future appointments. The card can serve as your preferred (primary) method of payment or simply filed as a back up method of payment. If significant collaboration is needed outside of sessions in form of phone calls with the patient or family members responsible for their care or other professionals, a charge will be incurred based on time allocated. Phone calls lasting longer than 15 minutes will be charged accordingly. If the provider is needed to travel to an out of office consultation, such as at a school, charges are billed at 150% of the in office fee and include travel time.</p>
                    <h2>Missed or late cancelled appointments</h2>
                    <p class="indent">Cancellation or rescheduling is required 24 hours in advance to avoid being charged for reserved appointment time. You are financially liable for the full fee if you fail to cancel your appointment 24 hours in advance. It is the patientâ€™s responsibility to know their appointment times.</p>
